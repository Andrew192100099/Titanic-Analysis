                                    *"April 15, 1912 — a cold night, a ship of dreams, and a tragedy that still echoes through history…"*

## **This project is not just data.**
It’s the story of **<ins>1,300+ passengers</ins>** aboard the Titanic — their fates sealed by class, gender, age, and chance.
Through Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we uncover patterns buried in the numbers.

## ❓ **Questions We Set Out to Answer**

● *Did gender decide survival?*

● *Were the rich in First Class more likely to make it?*

● *Did being a child offer protection, or a death sentence?*

● *Which deck and ticket class carried the highest risk?*

● *Was survival just luck… or was it mathematically predictable?*

## **🔍 What We Did**

**✔**  *Cleaned and explored the Titanic dataset using Python & Pandas.*

**✔** *Visualized patterns with Seaborn & Matplotlib.*

**✔** *Compared survival rates across gender, passenger class, and age groups.*

**✔** *Discovered hidden insights through EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).*

## **⚓ Why This Matters**

*Behind every row in the dataset is a life story.*

**<ins>Every 1</ins>** in the Survived column *means someone’s life was spared.*

**<ins>Every 0</ins>** *means history claimed another victim.*
